Description: Provide functionality to manage, clean and match highfrequency

    forecast volatility, detect price jumps and investigate microstructure noise and intraday
    periodicity. A detailed vignette can be found in the paper 
    "Analyzing intraday financial data in R: The highfrequency package" 
    by Boudt, Kleen, and Sjoerup (2022, <doi:10.2139/ssrn.3917548>).
